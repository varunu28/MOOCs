# Algorithms in Python

Implementation of algorithms in Python and solutions to the related problem sets of the algorithms course.
I will be implementing algorithms from the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization offered by UC San Diego at Coursera: 

[Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)

##Courses offered as a part of this specialization: 

1. [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox)
2. [Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures)
3. [Algorithms on Graphs and Trees](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs-and-trees)
4. [Algorithms on Strings](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings)
5. [Advanced Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-algorithms-and-complexity)
6. [Assembling Genomes and Finding Disease-Causing Mutations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assembling-genomes)
